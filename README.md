# Feature-Selection-Techniques
We will look at the different feature selection techniques: Wrapper, Embedded, Filter. We will create three classes for each feature selection method.

Under the three feature selection techniques, these are the different methods.

1. Wrapper - Forward feature selection, Backward feature selection 

2. Embedded - LASSO

3. Filter - Pearson, ANOVA, Chi-squared
